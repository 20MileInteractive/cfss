				<h4>Bonnie Walsh</h4>
				<p>
					I was first introduced to CrossFit in 2007 after having suffered a repetitive use injury from running. Having graduated from Bridgewater State University with a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice, I was hired on a local Department and was training for the police academy. Because I was unable to run anymore, I was in search of a new way to train. Always having been a competitive athlete, I was constantly seeking physical activities that were new and challenging.
				</p>
				<p>
					CrossFit turned out to be everything I was looking for, and then some. I was initially drawn to the CrossFit program due to its easy transference to “real world” situations. After regular participation in CrossFit classes, I noticed incredible gains in my strength and stamina, as well as my confidence. It propelled my baseline fitness level to new heights I didn’t know were possible for me, all the while giving me the friendly competition and teammate camaraderie that I had always loved from sports. Upon graduating the 6 month long police academy in 2009 I had broken multiple PT records (including a running record!) all of which I credit entirely to my CrossFit training.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because I had personally benefitted so much from the CrossFit method, I later became a certified CrossFit level 1 trainer, as well as a certified USAW Sports Performance Coach. Being able to share my love for CrossFit with others is such a fantastic feeling because I know how well the program works. I am so grateful for CrossFit and I look forward to sharing it with you.
