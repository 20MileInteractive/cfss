		<h4>Intro/Fundamentals</h4>
		<p>
			This program meets three times a week for two weeks. It begins on the first and third Monday of every month. During these initial sessions you will be exposed to a variety of exercise movements at light to moderate intensity levels while you become familiar with our methods. We are training movements, not muscles.  We are primarily looking for competency with these specific movement patterns.

		<h4>CrossFit Classes</h4>		
		<p>
			This class is built on the framework of Coach Rutherfordâ€™s renowned Max Effort Black Box (MEBB).  This training approach is the most popular strength template to improve CrossFit performance and athletic fitness.

			Created in 2003, the MEBB is a training approach combining CrossFit metabolic conditioning (METCON) laid upon a progressive strength template.  During the course of twelve months the athlete is exposed to a minimum of four different training templates all with a relative degree of dedicated strength work.
